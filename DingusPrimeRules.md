## DingusPrimeServer Rules

1) Don't take/kill/break/destroy/occupy/alter anything that you know for a fact belongs to another player or a town you're not part of.

2) Do not tell Peter/PeterCashel/pacas00 about ANYTHING related to the modpack, server, glitches, oddities, etc. Such reports should be made exclusively to NerdiCorgi.

3) Any factories/machines you make should stop when you leave the area or log off. If I have to implement an AFK kick, I will - but I won't be happy about it.

4) The major goals of this server are Exploration (thus no teleportation being allowed), Building (thus the huge amount of blocks and building materials), Travel (thus the trains), and Trade (thus the wallet/coins and shops). These 4 goals combine to form one larger goal for our entire player base: Community. If you're found to be harassing anyone from that community - you will be removed from everything I have /ban access to. Which, as it turns out, is a lot of shit.

5) If you're going to build a mob farm, it should require player input to utilize (meaning you need to swing a weapon to kill mobs). You can use machines to weaken mobs. But if you're automating the process of mob killing, odds are you're also putting undue strain on the server and and that will be very similar this next little rule here...

6) You are NOT, under any set of circumstances, including "accidentally", to build a lag machine. If we have to restore a backup to undo your shenanigans, you will never be given the chance for future shenanigans.




### Additional Information - ContentSync

This pack includes ContentSync. ContentSync is a mod that runs on game startup to let us download custom item textures and content scripts from our update server.
Basically, we can add more stuff without doing a whole pack update.

You'll first encounter it as a Red box on startup. Like below.

Sometimes after an update, ContentSync MIGHT tell you to restart your game. This isn't optional if you want to connect to the DingusPrime server without errors.
When this happens, close the game once it reaches the menu and re-open.
